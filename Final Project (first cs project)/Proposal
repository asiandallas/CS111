Prompt #1:  Explain the data you have organized in the "input.dat" file. Your explanation should be detailed enough for others to expand your data file with additional data using the same structure.

  The data I am taking is from my Spotify data saved in last.fm. I am focusing on my top 10 songs played between the months of January to April, specifically from January 1 through April 30 2021.
  In my Spotify structure, I will have the title of the song, the artist, and the duration of the song in minutes and seconds. In the struct array will be the number of times I played each song in the last 4 months.
  Each array will consist 4 elements, each month representing January-April.

Prompt #2:  What would the output look like if a user wants to browser your database without any filter or sorting criteria?

  I hope the output will look similar to this, neatly (left justified):
  Song | Artist | Duration | Plays in Jan .. Feb .. Mar .. Apr
  x      x        x:x                 x      x      x      x

Prompt #3: Give two example filter criteria that would be interesting to apply. These are not commitments you are making for the final project.

  - Display one artist of choice
  - Display songs depending depending how many times user wants me to have listened to

Prompt #4: Give two example sorting criteria that would be interesting to apply. These are not commitments you are making for the final project.

 - Display duration of songs in order of longest to shortest
 - Display artists in aphabetical order
 - Rank songs based on most played songs in the months of January, March, February, or April

Prompt #5: Describe two analyses that would focus on data within one group. These are not commitments you are making for the final project.

 - User will enter a song, return total times song was played 
 - Average songs played a month

Prompt #5: Describe two analyses that would require data from multiple groups. These are not commitments you are making for the final projeAct.

   - User will enter a month and return most played song/artist 
   - User will enter a month and will output the duration I listened to the songs

Prompt #6: How and why is this project personal or interesting to you?
  - I love listening to music and use spotify almost 24/7. Because I use the app so much, I was curious on how much I am really listening a month 
  as well as finding what artists/songs/albums are on repeat every week/month/year. I became interested in this after Spotify would usually do their
  Spotify Wrapped every end of the year. So I eventually signed up for last.fm to find these statistcs and check it once in a while. Because I am 
  highly interested in my Spotify data I thought it would be a perfect choice for this project.
